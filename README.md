# image-zoom-on-hover

<p>This is an image zoom-free project which works on mouse hover. In this project, whenever we move the cursor on the image it shows some details related to the image.</p>
<p>We can hide details using this project and we want to show details to the user, if the user hovers their mouse over it and if user clicks it, we can redirect user to our website or any particular page.</p>
